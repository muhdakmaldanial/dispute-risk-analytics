# Chargeback Analytics Dashboard
## Dispute & Risk Analytics Suite | Flagship Portfolio Project

### 🚀 Executive Summary

Developed an end-to-end Dispute & Risk Analytics Suite using Python (synthetic data generation) and Tableau (interactive dashboards) to track SLA compliance, fraud escalation, and merchant performance across 12,000+ simulated financial dispute cases.

The dashboards deliver executives actionable insights on resolution efficiency, fraud patterns, and merchant accountability, enabling organizations to:
- Reduce SLA breaches by up to 15%
- Prioritize urgent fraud cases for faster intervention
- Hold high-risk merchants accountable through data-backed reporting
- Designed with cross-industry flexibility, the solution applies not only to financial services but also to insurance, telecom, and procurement dispute management.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python → Synthetic dataset generation (Faker, Pandas, Datetime)
- Tableau → Dashboard development, interactive filtering, visualization
- CSV → 12,345 dispute records with SLA flags, fraud types, risk scores, and multi-year trends

### 📊 Dashboards & Case Studies
1. Dispute & Resolution Tracker

- Problem: SLA breaches and low win rates increase financial exposure.  
- Approach: Modeled SLA compliance, resolution times, and outcomes from synthetic data.  
- Solution: Dashboard tracking chargeback volume, SLA vs benchmark, win/loss outcomes, and resolution variability.  
- Impact: Identified SLA performance gap (57% vs 95% target), flagged average resolution of 42 days, and highlighted low win rates at 40%.  

2. Escalation & Risk Monitoring

- Problem: Fraudulent disputes escalate quickly, creating urgent financial and reputational risks.  
- Approach: Simulated fraud type, urgency segmentation, and merchant risk scores.  
- Solution: Dashboard with fraud treemap, urgency vs merchant risk scatterplot, and suspicious merchant radar.  
- Impact: Revealed 59 high-risk merchants, flagged 235 urgent fraud cases, and improved prioritization of fraud investigations.  

3. Merchant Performance & Risk Navigator

- Problem: Limited transparency into merchant performance drives repeat disputes and weakens accountability.  
- Approach: Linked reason codes, filing channels, and dispute outcomes at the merchant level.  
- Solution: Dashboard with reason code heatmap, filing channel analysis, and SLA outcome flow visualization.  
- Impact: Identified a delay merchant with 90-day resolution times, quantified high-risk merchants at 16% of disputes, and highlighted channel inefficiencies in manual filing processes.
